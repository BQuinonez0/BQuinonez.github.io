<h4> Hello! My name is Britney and I'm a recent graduate from Rutgers University with a Bachelor's in Management Information Systems. My passion lies in utilizing technology to solve real-world problems, and I hope to continue to do so in my career. Below are the two projects I have completed: 

<h2> Project 1: Electric Vehicles in Washington State 
<h4>This project is an analysis of electric vehicle (EV) data in Washington state using the Pandas library in Python. The goal is to understand the distribution and characteristics of EVs in Washington. The data was obtained from a CSV file from data.gov and contains information on the make, model, age, and county of registration for each EV in the state. The data was loaded and manipulated using Pandas and various functions were used for statistical analysis and generating summary statistics. 

<h2> Usage 
<h4> To run this project, you will need to have the following installed:

1. Python 3

2. Pandas library 
<h2> Project 2: Financial Data Tracking with SQL 
<h4> Implemented an SQL database to track financial transactions of a simulated company, showcasing ability to organize and manage financial data effectively. The project aims to provide a simple solution to keep track of financial transactions. The data is stored in a MySQL database and the information is extracted using SQL. The query returns the transaction ID, customer first name, customer last name, and the amount authorized. <h4> 

<h2> Usage 
<h4> To use this project, you need to have a MySQL installation and access to a database management tool. The SQL query used in this project can be easily modified to suit your specific needs. <h4>

<h2> Conclusion 
<h4> Thank you for reading!
